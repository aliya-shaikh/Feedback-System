# Feedback-System
This is my very first project in python as i am still in learning stage. 
I have created a desktop application "FEEDBACK SYSTEM" where you user can give feedback for different website its all categorized.
and based on all the reviews a graph and pie chart will be appeared and it show which website is leading and we can comapre 2 or 3 website or all 5 to (as i added only 5 website in each category).
I upload the database file too because i was learning mysql also, so i explicitly created the tables.
So to run this project you need python 3.7 or higher versions.
                           https://www.python.org/downloads/
and you have to install all the libraries via cmd as i import all libraries so just by writting this code you can install it.
                            pip install "library name"
                            pip install pandas
